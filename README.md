# ELEC1601 Group 8 Exercise 3

Worked with light sensors and continuous servos to simulate how a robot might work.

## Part 3

### How the code is structured

Wheels is a class that controls the movement of the robot, with methods for the 4 movement types specified.
LightSensor is a class that wraps pins which are connected to the light sensor on either side.
The loop calls the light sensorâ€™s checking function to read from its analog pin and see if it should turn or not. Otherwise it just keeps moving forward.

### Complications

Initially I tried initialising the servos in the Wheels constructor but that didn't work because of the order the code is compiled in resulting in weird behaviour from the servo library. So I had to initialise them separately and attach them separately which is not ideal but it works.

> Formatting/spacing is also weird from tinkercad
